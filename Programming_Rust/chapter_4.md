# Ownership and Moves

In Rust, ownership is a central concept that governs how the borrowing and mutability of variables are managed in the program. Ownership is based on the idea that each value in Rust has a single owner, and the owner is responsible for the value's lifetime.

One of the key features of ownership is that it ensures that a value is automatically cleaned up when it is no longer needed, a process known as "dropping". This helps prevent memory leaks and makes it easier to reason about the lifetime of values in a Rust program.

One aspect of ownership is "move semantics". In Rust, when a value is assigned to a new variable, the ownership of the value is transferred to the new variable. This is known as a "move". For example:

```rust
let x = String::from("hello");
let y = x;
```

In this code, the value of `x` is moved to `y`, and `x` is no longer valid. This is because Rust assumes that the original owner (in this case, `x`) is no longer interested in the value and it is safe to transfer ownership to the new owner (`y`).

Move semantics are important because they allow Rust to optimize memory usage by avoiding unnecessary copies of data. However, they also mean that once a value has been moved, the original value can no longer be used.

You can use the `clone` method to create a deep copy of a value if you need to use the original value after it has been moved. This can be useful in cases where you need to retain ownership of a value while also using it in multiple places.
